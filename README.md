# Movie Theatre Simulation using FLEXSIM

Our project is a model of the AMC Roosevelt Field 8 cinema using <a href="https://www.flexsim.com">FLEXSIM</a>.
All the values calculated and utilized in this model are accurately approximated to mimic the real-life scenario. 

## Contents

1. FINAL REPORT.pdf - a PDF of the full report explaining the realistic model in simplistic steps containing the following:
    1. Model Assumptions
    2. Model Settings
    3. Flow of the Model
    4. Breakdown of Arrivals, Buying/Scanning Tickets, Concessions, Movie Theatres
        1. This includes the group splits, arrival times, group flow, and mathematical distributions
    5. Statistics
        1. This includes expected waiting time in queue, expected number of groups in queue, expected number of groups in system, and expected waiting time in system
    6. Analysis of Current System and Recommendation of Improvements
2. WorkingFinalModifiedModel.fsm - a 3D Simulation FLEXSIM file of the model
3. Modified System Statistics.html - a report of the statistics gathered for the model
4. all times.xlsm - an excel sheet of interarrival times for the model
